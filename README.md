## YouPun
is a chatbot which replies and chats humorously making shitty puns.

# Project Dependencies are 

-BotBuilder framework for Node.Js (npm install BotBuilder)
-Restify for server based applications(npm install Restify)
-Bot-Framework Emulator for debugging it (or Use VSCode for it).
-ngork to connect logal host to a Remote Server

# How it Works
YouPun works on Phonetics of Language English and Thereby doesn't support any other Language.

After Having the reply we just need to replace a noun with other word having atleast n-2 phonetics in common (considering n phonetics of the word)(from Dictionary).

# Finally
This v1.0 may not make sense in replies but maybe after some development it will.

# Thankyou
KUDOS to Everyone Reading this and Failing to understand.
